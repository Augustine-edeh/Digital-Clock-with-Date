This is a basic Repository where you'd find codes I've written (done)/still writing (In progress).
All from my mobile phone. For these projects I make use of an application (Spck Editor) on my mobile and it's a really super mobile code Editor that suits my code writing needs, equiped with the amazing Emmet feature and a whole lot more.

~Stay tuned!
